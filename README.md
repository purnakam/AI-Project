## 1. Hand Tracking Module

The hand tracking module employs computer vision techniques to detect and track human hands in real-time. It is developed using Python and relies on OpenCV and other libraries. Follow the steps below to set up and run the hand tracking module:

### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `hand_tracking_module` directory.
4. Execute the `hand_tracking.py` script to initiate the hand tracking module.

### Usage

- Once the script is running, it will utilize your webcam to detect and track hand movements.
- Adjust the module's parameters as needed to enhance hand detection and tracking for your specific use case.

## 2. AI Virtual Mouse

The AI virtual mouse project enables mouse cursor control through hand gestures detected by the hand tracking module. Here's how to utilize it:

### Setup

1. Ensure that the hand tracking module is set up and operational as described above.
2. Navigate to the `ai_virtual_mouse` directory.
3. Run the `virtual_mouse.py` script to launch the AI virtual mouse.

### Usage

- Utilize predefined hand gestures to manipulate the mouse cursor's movements.
- Refer to the documentation provided within the `virtual_mouse.py` script for a comprehensive list of supported gestures and their associated actions.
